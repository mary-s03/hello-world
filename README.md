My name is Mary, and I am a fourth-year graduate student in Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics. 
I spend most of my time doing experiments or reading topic-related publications in the lab.
I like to read or watch thrillers, mysteries, and horror on my time off and play Call of Duty.
I also enjoy cooking for my family and hanging out with them. 
I'm grateful for this incredible opportunity, and I look forward to learning as much as possible and using the skills I acquire in my future scientific career.
